# Rails Feature Toggle Example

This is an example from my talk When You Say DevOps showing how simple
it is to implement feature toggles yourself and start growing them for
your needs from there. This can be constrasted with third-party
solution (library or service) which can bring unnecessary complexity
to your project especially if you and your team are still learning how
powerfull feature toggles can be.

I will add notes about what to look for in the code in future
commits. It is still a result of running `rails new` so there is
nothing special here.
